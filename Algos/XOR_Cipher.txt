XOR Encryption is an encryption method used to encrypt data and is hard to crack by brute-force method, i.e generating random encryption keys to match with the correct one. 

Below is a simple implementation in C++. The concept of implementation is to first define XOR â€“ encryption key and then to perform XOR operation of the characters in the String with this key which you want to encrypt. To decrypt the encrypted characters we have to perform XOR operation again with the defined key. Here we are encrypting the entire String.
